# challenge8-teamProfileGenerator

## Description

The motivation for the project was to create a webpage that allows managers to quickly generate and find basic information about their team. This project was undertaken to better learn classes, tests, and there integration with jest and inquirer. This interactive application allows the user to add as many employees as they would like along with their individual roles and information. Through this project I have gained a much better understanding of jest tests and classes.
